# ATM-Management-System
Welcome to my ATM System project! This is a simple imlementation of an ATM in C++. I built this project as a part of my learning process by applying the concepts i studied into a real project. in this project i have used various C++ concepts especially OOP and other concepts including File handling,Pointers,Standard Template Library(Vectors) and so on . With this program, users can manage their bank accounts, perform transactions, and view their account details.

## Features

- Create New Account: Users can create a new bank account by providing their account number, name, a 4-digit PIN, and an initial deposit.
- Login: Users can log in to their account using their account number and PIN.
- Deposit: Users can deposit money into their account to increase their balance.
- Withdraw: Users can withdraw money from their account if there is sufficient balance.
- Check Balance: Users can check their current account balance at any time.
- Transaction History: Users can view  records of all deposits and withdrawals  on their account.
- Change PIN: Users can change their account PIN .

## File Management
Account details such as account number, holder name, balance, and PIN are saved in a file  `accounts.txt`(here the file is empty). On login or any  account-related operation, the file is read and updated.
